# Rainbow Arena
A game made with LÖVE (http://love2d.org/) in which circles shoot each other.

Or at least, that's the goal.

## Goal
The end goal is for Rainbow Arena to be a chaotic match-based multiplayer arena shooter, with all sorts of crazy weapons, from standard projectile weapons firing standard bullets, to sticky bomb launchers, to beam lasers, to tractor beams.

## Running
Rainbow Arena runs on LÖVE 11.3. It has some dependencies as Git submodules.
